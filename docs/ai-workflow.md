# AI Coding Protocol

## Atomic Flow
1. One chat = one method (or one tightly related method pair).
2. Generate tests first.
3. Manually validate test cases.
4. Generate implementation.
5. Run tests.
6. Review with checklist.
7. Commit.

## Anti-chaos Rules
- No broad refactors inside method task.
- No parallel implementation until 3-5 methods are stable.
- Keep prompt context minimal and targeted.
